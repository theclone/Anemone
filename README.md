# Anemone

A voice program that attempts to help users with their pronunciation, using Dragon Mobile and Merriam-Webster APIs to analyze user pronunciation.

We hope to provide an active listening and correction functionality alongside studying tools such as vocab lists and flashcards.

In the future, we have plans to implement speech practice in realistic scenarios using directional audio output provided by Dolby APIs as well as a database for slang that users can contribute to.
